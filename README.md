# Isly
A .NET proposition (assertion) framework written properly. Not how it [should be](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly), but how it is.

(The idea that I could "test-drive" it - [check-drive](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856) it? - and therefore bootstrap it, is incredibly pleasing.)
